Problem 2 - c
=============

(1) **Plot** both temperature contours and centerline profiles (T vs. :math:`x` or :math:`y` through center) for each different method.


- CASE1: Jacobi method

  (a) Temperature contour

    .. figure:: ./images/prob2_NumericalJacobi.png
       :scale: 80%

  (b) Temperature along the center line

    .. figure:: ./images/solutions_Jacobi.png
       :scale: 60%
