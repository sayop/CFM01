Problem 1 - b
=============

Given conditions: :math:`U` = 1, :math:`\Gamma` = 0.1, and :math:`Q` = 0. Use TDMA to find :math:`\phi`. 

(1) **Plot** :math:`\phi` vs. :math:`x` on the same graph using grid sizes of :math:`N` = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and **compare** your result to the analytical solution.

  (a) *Grid size, N = 50* with full scale

     :scale: 60%

  (b) Effect of grid size on numerical solution in magnified scale

     :scale: 80%

(2) **Plot** the average error as a function of :math:`N` in a log scale and normalization with respect to grid size.

(3) **Examine** how the calculation time changes with :math:`N` and **evaluate** the time complexity of the algorithm.
